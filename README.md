# PulseEffects-Presets
A collection of my presets for [PulseEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects) on Linux.

* **Normalizer** - A volume normalizer without Auto-Gain plugin (plus a version with bass enhanced). Useful if you're looking for a steady sound level in high dynamic contents like movies when you don't want to adjust volume too many times.

* **Laptop Normalizer** - A volume normalizer with huge bass enhacer for Laptops with speakers that cannot reproduce low-end signals.
